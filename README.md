## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I add an app/client?

Visit the OAuth2 Complete dashboard by clicking `Provider` in the WordPress admin panel. Once you are in the dashboard, there is a form labeled `Add Client`. Give your client a name and a redirect URI. The redirect URI is the HTTP location where the user will be returned to after authenticating (your client should provide this for you). Click `Add Client` and your client will be added to your Consumer Manager table.

### How does a client connect to my website to use the Single Sign On?

Currently there is 3 Methods that OAuth2 Provider has built in:

1. http://example.com/oauth/authorize

1. http://example.com/oauth/request_token

1. http://example.com/oauth/request_access

Authorize requires only 3 parameters:

* client_id
* response_type - Supported value's = `code`
* state
* Example call `http://example.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=the_client_id&state=anything_you_want&response_type=code`

Request Token Requires only 4 parameters

* code - This is auth code returned from the authorize call
* grant_type - Supported value's = `authorization_code`
* client_id
* client_secret
* Example call `http://example.com/oauth/request_token?code=the_auth_key_sent_back_from_the_authorize_call&grant_type=authorization_code&client_id=the_client_id&client_secret=the_client_secret`

Request Access Requires only 1 parmeter

* access_token - This is the access_token provided from the Request Token call
* Example Call `http://example.com/oauth/request_access?access_token=the_token_from_the_request_call`


NOTE: All returns will be in JSON format.


### Can you set this up for me on my current website?

Yes. You are more than welcome to contact us if you should ever need assistance.

### What information does the a authorized client have access to?

By default OAuth2 Provider delivers <strong>ALL</strong> the information about the user that logged in. We are planning on adding a easy to use dashboard to limit data.


## Upgrade Notice

When upgrading OAuth2 Provider, I seriously recommend creating a backup of your site. I will try to create updates that will be flawless. Hopefully any future updates will not change to the point where it will stop working. All updates will be ran through multiple tests before being released. In the event that an upgrade of OAuth2 Provider is released and you decide to update, I (Justin Greer) can not and will not be held responsible for any damages done to your website, business, or part that pertains to your website. Upgrade at your OWN RISK!
